![<MographToNulls_Python.gif>](https://github.com/lasselauch/c4d-presets/blob/master/img/MographToNulls_Python.gif)</br>
_Original Coffee-Script & Concept by Per Anders. (http://peranders.com/)_</br></br>
<b>The awesome Xpresso/Coffee Script from Per Anders just got updated!</b></br>
Since R20 Coffee-Script is no longer supported in C4D, so I decided to revamp the good old Preset from Per and while at it add support for Mograph-Selections as well! _(Mograph-Selections got introduced in R18)_</br>

+ Follow Clones with Nulls or any other Object
+ Transfer Display-Color from Clones to Objects
+ Compatibility: <b>R16 and up...</b>
