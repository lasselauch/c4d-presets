_Original Coffee-Script & Concept by Per Anders. (http://peranders.com/)_</br></br>
<b>The awesome Xpresso/Coffee Script from Per Anders just got updated!</b></br>
Since R20 Coffee-Script is no longer supported in C4D, so I decided to revamp the good old Preset from Per and while at it add support for Mograph-Selections as well!</br>
</br>
+ Follow Clones with Nulls or any other Object
+ <b>R20 ready</b> but also works in older Versions ( R16-R20 )
