### MographToNulls_Python.c4d

_Original Coffee-Script & Concept by Per Anders. (http://peranders.com/)_</br></br>
<b>The awesome Xpresso/Coffee Script from Per Anders just got updated!</b></br>
Since R20 Coffee-Script is no longer supported in C4D, so I decided to revamp the good old Preset from Per and while at it add support for Mograph-Selections as well! _(Mograph-Selections got introduced in R18)_</br>

+ Follow Clones with Nulls or any other Object
+ Transfer Display-Color from Clones to Objects
+ Compatibility: <b>R16 and up...</b>
</br>

### take-hud-helper.c4d

![<take-hud-helper.gif>](https://github.com/lasselauch/c4d-presets/blob/master/img/take-hud-helper.gif)</br>
_This idea has recently been discussed on mograph.com Slack-Channel._</br></br>
<b>Gives you a better indicator when working with takes. Just merge it into your scene and you're good to go.</b></br>
</br>

+ Change Color for Auto Take within Settings
+ Compatibility: <b>R18 and up...</b>
+ more features to come...
</br>

**KNOWN-LIMITATIONS:**
+ "[ Auto-Take enabled ]" might be drawn behind Objects...
+ Currently drawing behind Safe-Frames, not sure how to work around that...
